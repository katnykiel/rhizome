# rhizome

## Installation

work in progress... email me if you are curious about getting this setup

## Motivation

Throughout my PhD, I've been motivated to cultivate a personal knowledge management system that:

  - passively collects and structures information
  - actively creates new connections
  - builds off the foundation of existing thoughts

> these need to be clarified: what are 'collect', 'structure', 'builds off' specifically?

All of this is motivated by fear that I'll write the same thing in my notes twice, miss an important connection, or waste my time doing what I could have automated. I think creating a rhizomatic machine that takes a given piece of context, searches through an embedding space, and returns related ideas can help alleviate these fears.

## Implementation

still in the brainstorming phase... a rag system like [r2r](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R) with [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) seems to be the optimal backend, maybe with some [langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) sprinkled in
