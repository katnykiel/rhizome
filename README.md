# rhizome



## Installation

work in progress... email me if you are curious about getting this setup

## Motivation

Throughout my PhD, I've been motivated to cultivate a personal knowledge management system that:

  - passively collects and structures information
  - actively creates new connections
  - builds off the foundation of existing thoughts

All of this is motivated by a fear that I'll write the same thing in my notes twice. I think that creating a rhizomatic machine that takes a given piece of context, searches through an embedding space, and returns related ideas. 

## Implementation

still in the brainstorming phase...
